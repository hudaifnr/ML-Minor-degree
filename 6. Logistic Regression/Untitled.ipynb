    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for binary classification where we use a logistic function, also known as a sigmoid function that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1. For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of the logistic function for an input is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to Class 1 it belongs to Class 0. It’s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear regression but is mainly used for classification problems. The difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear regression output is the continuous value that can be anything while logistic regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not."

    "<li>Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value.\n",
    "<li>It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the <li>probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.\n",
    "<li>Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they are used. Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.\n",
    "<li>In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an “S” shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).\n",
    "<li>The curve from the logistic function indicates the likelihood of something such as whether the cells are cancerous or not, a mouse is obese or not based on its weight, etc.\n",
    "<li>Logistic Regression is a significant machine learning algorithm because it has the ability to provide probabilities and classify new data using continuous and discrete datasets.\n",
    "<li>Logistic Regression can be used to classify the observations using different types of data and can easily determine the most effective variables used for the classification.\n",
    "<li>Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function):\n",
    "<li>The sigmoid function is a mathematical function used to map the predicted values to probabilities.\n",
    "<li>It maps any real value into another value within a range of 0 and 1. The value of the logistic regression must be between 0 and 1, which cannot go beyond this limit, so it forms a curve like the “S” form.\n",
    "<li>The S-form curve is called the Sigmoid function or the logistic function.\n",
    "<li>In logistic regression, we use the concept of the threshold value, which defines the probability of either 0 or 1. Such as values above the threshold value tends to 1, and a value below the threshold values tends to 0.\n",
